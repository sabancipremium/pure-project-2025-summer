# Strain Engineering Magnetism in Heusler Alloys

A comprehensive website showcasing research on magnetostriction and strain-dependent anisotropy in Heusler alloys using computational methods and density functional theory.

## üî¨ Project Overview

This research project investigates how to control magnetism with mechanics in Heusler alloys using computational modeling to understand how applying mechanical strain changes the material's magnetic anisotropy. We use Density Functional Theory (DFT) to calculate crucial magnetoelastic coupling coefficients (B‚ÇÅ and B‚ÇÇ).
